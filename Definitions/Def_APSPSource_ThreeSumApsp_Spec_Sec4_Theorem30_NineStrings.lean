# Strings of digits with a bounded number of nines (Section 4.2, proofs of Lemma 29, Theorem 30)

All three enumerations of Section 4 come from one: `nineStrs n lo hi`, the strings of n digits
0, …, 9 in which the digit 9 (the digit of P₀) occurs at least lo and at most hi times, in
lexicographic order.

* The boxes with e stars are the leaves with between e and m - t symbols P₀, with their e lowest
  symbols P₀ turned into stars (the proof of Lemma 29).
* The leaves of order below t contributing to an output string η (the paper's w) have, at the m
  levels of its inner set Q, a string with at least m - t + 1 nines (proof of Theorem 30).
* The boxes of η have, at the m levels of Q, a string with exactly m - t nines, the nines being the
  levels of V (Section 4.2).

The file proves what the list contains (`mem_nineStrs`), that it is increasing
(`pairwise_lt_nineStrs`), how long it is (`length_nineStrs`: ∑_f binom(n, f) 9^{n-f}), and how a
routine goes through it: it starts with `nineFirst` (`head?_nineStrs`), and `nineNext` goes from
each string to the next (`nineNext_getElem`); so the string reached after i steps,
`nineStr n lo hi i`, is the member number i (`getElem_nineStrs`).  Read from the right end of the
string, `nineNext` is one pass: skip the positions that cannot be raised, raise one digit
(`nineRaise`), and fill the rest with the least admissible string, zeros followed by nines.  The
proof follows the recursion of the list: the strings with the first digit d form a block,
`nineNext` goes through each block (`nextTo_map_cons`), and from the last string of a block to the
first string of the next block (`head_nineBlocks`).
